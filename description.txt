This is a sandboxing mod created with the sole purpose of learning about the tModLoader API, along with Microsoft's XNA Framework. This mod is not serious and is only meant for experimenting.

Please note that most of this mod's textures are not of my own. This is simply because I don't want to make my own sprites when my main focus is learning the API. Everything else is my own.
